# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Explore the Netflix dataset to gain insights into the trends and factors influencing the duration of movies. Investigate whether movie lengths are declining over time and identify contributing factors. Additionally, analyze movie descriptions to identify keywords associated with longer or shorter durations.

## Analysis Questions

Certainly! Here are some analysis questions you can explore using the Netflix dataset to investigate the average duration of movies and potential contributing factors:

1. **Is the Average Duration of Movies Declining?**
   - Calculate the average duration of movies over different years.
   - Visualize the trend in average movie durations over the years.

2. **Comparison of Movie Durations by Genre:**
   - Analyze the average duration of movies in different genres.
   - Identify genres where movies tend to be shorter or longer.

3. **Effect of Country on Movie Durations:**
   - Investigate if there's a correlation between the country of origin and movie durations.
   - Compare the average duration of movies from different countries.

4. **Release Year vs. Duration Trends:**
   - Explore whether there is a correlation between the release year of a movie and its duration.
   - Check if newer movies tend to be shorter than older ones.

5. **Impact of Directors on Movie Durations:**
   - Examine whether certain directors are associated with shorter or longer movies.
   - Identify directors whose movies consistently have a specific duration pattern.

6. **Analysis of Movie Durations by Type (Movie/TV Show):**
   - Compare the average duration of movies with that of TV shows.
   - Determine if there are notable differences between the two.

7. **Changes Over Time:**
   - Explore if there are specific periods or decades where there was a significant change in average movie durations.
   - Check if there are any patterns related to industry trends or technological advancements.

8. **Top Countries with Shortest/Longest Movies:**
   - Identify countries that produce movies with the shortest and longest durations.
   - Investigate if there are cultural or regional factors influencing movie lengths.

9. **Relationship Between Cast and Movie Durations:**
   - Analyze whether the cast of a movie is correlated with its duration.
   - Explore if movies with certain actors tend to have consistent durations.

10. **Impact of Movie Descriptions on Duration:**
    - Check if there's a correlation between the length or complexity of movie descriptions and the actual duration of the movie.
    - Investigate if certain types of descriptions are associated with shorter or longer movies.

11. **Keywords in Descriptions and Movie Durations:**
    - Analyze movie descriptions to identify keywords or phrases that are associated with longer or shorter durations.
    - Explore whether certain types of content or themes mentioned in descriptions correlate with specific movie lengths.
