# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! Here, I explore and analyze various datasets to gain insights and draw meaningful conclusions. Below, you'll find details about one of my projects:

## 1.Investigating Netflix Movies


This project is my first venture into data analysis, where I delve into the world of Netflix movies. I aim to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting information about the movies available on the platform.

### Project Overview

- **The project and Dataset**: [Netflix Movies Dataset](https://github.com/MahmoudNamNam/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies)
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn , sklearn

### Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: I cleaned the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
3. **Insights and Findings**: Documented interesting findings and insights gained from the analysis.



## 2. Policing and Weather Analysis

In my second project, I explore the intriguing relationship between weather conditions and policing activities in Rhode Island. By merging datasets on traffic stops and weather information, I aim to uncover patterns and insights that may provide a nuanced understanding of law enforcement practices.

### Project Overview

- **The project and Dataset**: [Policing and Weather Analysis](https://github.com/MahmoudNamNam/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Analyzing%20Police%20Activity)
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Key Components

1. **Integration of Datasets**: Merged the policing dataset with weather data to enable a comprehensive analysis.
2. **Correlation Exploration**: Investigated the correlation between weather elements and the frequency of traffic stops.
3. **Temporal Patterns and Extreme Weather Impact**: Analyzed temporal patterns and the influence of extreme weather on policing outcomes.
4. **Visualizations**: Incorporated visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
